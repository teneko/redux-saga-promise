# @teroneko/redux-saga-promise

Simple clean utility to define actions that return promises, for use with [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org)

Initially forked from [@adobe/redux-saga-promise](https://github.com/adobe/redux-saga-promise) but completelly revamped to use `createAction` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to support **TypeScript**.

# Overview

The library provides:

* Action creators, `promiseActionFactory<PromiseResolveValue>().simple(type)` and `promiseActionFactory<PromiseResolveValue>().advanced(type, prepareAction)` that you can use to define actions which return promises when the pomise middleware has been surpassed. We call an action that returns a promise a *promise action*.
 
* Saga helpers `implementPromiseAction()`, `resolvePromiseAction()`, and`rejectPromiseAction()` that you use to resolve or reject a promise action"s promise.

* Lifecyle actions `promise.trigger`, `promise.resolved`, and `promise.rejected` that you can use in reducers (or wherever you want)

* Middleware that makes it work.

* TypeScript helper types and functions

These are described in detail below.

# Installation

As usual, install via:

```
npm install @teroneko/redux-saga-promise
```

# Usage

## Including the middleware:

You must include include `promiseMiddleware` in the middleware chain, and it must come *before* `sagaMiddleware`:

```js
import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from "redux"
import { promiseMiddleware }            from "@teroneko/redux-saga-promise"
import createSagaMiddleware             from "redux-saga"

// ...assuming rootReducer and rootSaga are defined
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()
const store          = createStore(rootReducer, {}, applyMiddleware(promiseMiddleware, sagaMiddleware))
sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga)
```

## Creating a promise action:

Create a promise action using `promiseActionFactory<PromiseResolveValue()>().simple(type)` and `promiseActionFactory<PromiseResolveValue()>().advanced(type, prepareAction)` or , analogous to `createAction` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`:

```js
import { promiseActionFactory } from "@teroneko/redux-saga-promise"

export const promiseAction = promiseActionFactory<number>().simple("MY_ACTION") 
                    //  promiseActionFactory<number>().advanced(type, prepareCreator)
```

## Resolving/rejecting the action in a saga:

It is up to you as the implementer to resolve or reject the promise"s action
in a saga.  There are three helpers you can use as needed:

### `implementPromiseAction(action, saga)`

The most convenient way!  You give this helper a saga function which it
will execute.  If the saga function succesfully returns a value, the promise will
resolve with that value.   If the saga function throws an error, the promise
will be rejected with that error.  For example:

```js
import { call, takeEvery }        from "redux-saga/effects"
import { promises as fsPromises } from "fs"
import { implementPromiseAction } from "@teroneko/redux-saga-promise"

import promiseAction from "./promiseAction"

//
// Asynchronously read a file, resolving the promise with the file"s
// contents, or rejecting the promise if the file can"t be read.
//
function * handlePromiseAction (action) {
  yield call(implementPromiseAction, action, function * () {
    // 
    // Implemented as a simple wrapper around fsPromises.readFile.
    // Rejection happens implicilty if fsPromises.readFile fails.
    //
    const { path } = action.payload
    return yield call(fsPromises.readFile, path, { encoding: "utf8" })
  })
}

export function * rootSaga () {
  yield takeEvery(promiseAction, handlePromiseAction)
})
```

If you call `implementPromiseAction()` with a first argument that is not a
promise action, it will throw an error (see [Argument Validation](#argument-validation) below).

### `resolvePromiseAction(action, value)`

Sometimes you may want finer control, or want to be more explicit when you know an
operation won"t fail.  This helper causes the promise to resolve with the
passed value.  For example:

```js
import { call, delay, takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects"
import { resolvePromiseAction }   from "@teroneko/redux-saga-promise"

import promiseAction from "./promiseAction"

//
// Delay a given number of seconds then resolve with the given value.
//
function * handlePromiseAction (action) {
  const { seconds, value } = action.payload
  yield delay(seconds*1000)
  yield call(resolvePromiseAction, action, value)
}

function * rootSaga () {
  yield takeEvery(promiseAction, handlePromiseAction)
})
```

If you call `resolvePromiseAction()` with a first argument that is not a
promise action, it will throw an error (see [Argument Validation](#argument-validation) below).

### `rejectPromiseAction(action, value)`

Sometimes you may want finer control, or want to explicitly fail without needing to `throw`. This helper causes the promise to reject with the
passed value, which typically should be an `Error`.  For example:

```js
import { call, takeEvery }     from "redux-saga/effects"
import { rejectPromiseAction } from "@teroneko/redux-saga-promise"

import promiseAction from "./promiseAction"

//
// TODO: Implement this!   Failing for now
//
function * handlePromiseAction (action) {
  yield call(rejectPromiseAction, action, new Error("Sorry, promiseAction is not implemented yet")
}

function * rootSaga () {
  yield takeEvery(promiseAction, handlePromiseAction)
})
```

If you call `rejectPromiseAction()` with a first argument that is not a
promise action, it will throw an error (see [Argument Validation](#ArgumentValidation) below).


## Action lifecycle -- reducing the promise action:

Commonly you want the redux store to reflect the status of a promise action:
whether it"s pending, what the resolved value is, or what the rejected error
is.

Behind the scenes, `promiseAction = promiseActionFactory().simple("MY_ACTION")` actually
creates a suite of three actions:

* `promiseAction.trigger`: An alias for `promiseAction`, which is what you dispatch that then creates the promise.

* `promiseAction.resolved`: Dispatched automatically by `promiseMiddleware` when the promise is resolved; its payload is the resolved value of the promise

* `promiseAction.rejected`: Dispatched automatically by `promiseMiddleware` when the promise is rejected; its payload is the rejection error of the promise

You can easily use them in `handleActions` of [redux-actions](https://redux-actions.js.org) or `createReducer` of `@reduxjs/toolkit`:

```js
import { handleActions } from "redux-actions"
import promiseAction from "./promiseAction"

//
// For the readFile wrapper described above, we can keep track of the file in the store
//
export const reducer = handleActions({
    [promiseAction.trigger]:  (state, { payload: { path } }) => ({ ...state, file: { path, status: "reading"} }),
    [promiseAction.resolved]: (state, { payload: contents }) => ({ ...state, file: { path: state.file.path, status: "read", contents } }),
    [promiseAction.rejected]: (state, { payload: error })    => ({ ...state, file: { path: state.file.path, status: "failed", error } }),
  }, {})
```

## Dispatching a promise action in a saga

In the sagas that perform your business logic, you may at times want to dispatch a promise action and wait for it to resolve.  You can do that using redux-saga"s [`putResolve`](http://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#putresolveaction) Effect:

```const result = yield putResolve(myPromiseAction)```

This dispatches the action and waits for the promise to resolve, returning the resolved  value.  Or if the promise rejects it will bubble up an error.

*Caution!* If you use [`put()`](http://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#putaction`) instead of `putResolve()`, the saga will continue execution immediately without waiting for the promise to resolve.

## <a name="argument-validation"></a> Argument Validation

To avoid accidental confusion, all the helper functions validate their
arguments and will throw a custom `Error` subclass `ArgumentError` in case
of error.  This error will be bubbled up by redux-saga as usual, and as usual you can catch it in a saga otherwise it will will bubble up to the [`onError`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#createsagamiddlewareoptions) hook.  If you want to, you can test the error type, e.g.:

```js
import { applyMiddleware, compose, createStore } from "redux"
import { ArgumentError, promiseMiddleware }      from "@teroneko/redux-saga-promise"
import createSagaMiddleware                      from "redux-saga"

// ...assuming rootReducer and rootSaga are defined
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware({ onError: (error) => {
  if (error instanceof ArgumentError) {
    console.log("Oops, programmer error! I called redux-saga-promise incorrectly:", error)
  } else {
    // ...
  }
})
const store = createStore(rootReducer, {}, compose(applyMiddleware(promiseMiddleware, sagaMiddleware)))
sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga)
```

Additionally, all the helper functions will throw a custom `Error` subclass `ConfigurationError` if `promiseMiddleware` was not properly included in the store.

## TypeScript helper types

`promiseAction.types ` does not really exist- it only exists as TypeScript-type to make use of `typeof`:

```js
const promiseAction = promiseActionFactory<number>().simple("MY_ACTION");

declare const typeOfTriggerActionThatGotCreatedFromTheSimpleOrAdvancedActionCreator: typeof promiseAction.types.triggerAction;
declare const typeOfResolvedActionThatGotCreatedFromTheSimpleOrAdvancedActionCreator: typeof promiseAction.types.resolvedAction;
declare const typeOfRejectedActionThatGotCreatedFromTheSimpleOrAdvancedActionCreator: typeof promiseAction.types.rejectedAction;
declare const typeOfPromiseThatGotCreatedOfPromiseMiddleware: typeof promiseAction.types.promise;
declare const typeOfResolvedValueFromPromiseThatGotCreatedOfPromiseMiddleware: typeof promiseAction.types.resolveValue;

const promise = store.dispatch(promiseAction()).meta.promise; // OR
           // = store.dispatch(promiseAction()) as any as typeof promiseAction.types.promise;
```

`redux-saga` cannot infer the parameters and return type of `promiseAction` correctly when using the call effect or equivalent, so you can use the pre-typed sagas:

```js
const { implement, resolve, reject } = promiseAction.sagas;

// Instead of this...
call(implementPromiseAction, promiseAction(), () => 2);
// ... use this for better TypeScript support:
call(promiseAction.sagas.implement, promiseAction(), () => 2);
```

### Building & Testing

`package.json` defines the usual scripts:

* `npm install`: install node packages.
* `npm build`: transpiles the source, placing the result in `dist/src/index.js`.
* `npm test`: builds, and then runs the test suite.

The tests are written using `ts-jest`;
